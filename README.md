# Bayesian Networks

This project brings together several methods from the Bayesian 
Network literature, including data generation, parameter inference and
structure learning. 

We are a long way away, but this is a good start.

The code is written in C++ and can be compiled using CMake, which
automatically finds dependencies and links the libraries and executables.
